clicker.exe [options ...] <path to MIDI.mid>

Description:
Clicker generates a WAVE file click track given a MIDI sequence with meter/key
and tempo change messages. The click track serves as a solid, sample-accurate
metronome that will line up with the MIDI sequence. You can import the
generated click track into any MIDI-friendly DAW tool such as SONAR, Cubase,
etc. to record with. You can even share the click track with other recording
artists working on your project to serve as a timebase to help synchronize work
across distances.
